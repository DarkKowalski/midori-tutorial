# Introduction

## What is midori?

Midori (pronounced /miːdɒliː/) is a **Ruby web framework** for building APIs, web pages and realtime web services. Midori is designed to provide **non-blocking** I/O operations without **callback hells** on web development. The core library is focused on network I/Os, and gives a very easy DSL to pick up and converting existed projects on. On the other hand, midori also officially provides extension libraries that could deal with file, database, cache, network requests and other I/O operations without blocking.

If you want to know how midori compares to other libraries/frameworks, checkout out the [Comparison with Other Frameworks](meta/comparison_with_other_frameworks.md)

## Note

The official guide assumes intermediate level knowledge of Ruby and backend development. If you are totally new , it might not be the best idea to jump right into a framework as your first step - grasp the basics then come back! Prior experience with other frameworks like Rails helps, but is not required.
